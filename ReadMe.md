Sciigo is a lightweight notification framework for Nagios (and, with a few changes, icinga). 

It is used by EOX to send pushover notifications to iOS and Android devices, as well as text messages to mobile phones.

Sciigo is based on a modular architecture, allowing it to be extended quite easily.
